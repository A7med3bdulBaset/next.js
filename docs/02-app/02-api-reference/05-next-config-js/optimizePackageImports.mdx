Some packages can export hundreds or thousands of modules, which can cause performance issues in development and production.

Adding a package to `experimental.optimizePackageImports` will only load the modules you are actually using, while still giving you the convenience of writing import statements with many named exports.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ['package-name'],
  },
}
```
